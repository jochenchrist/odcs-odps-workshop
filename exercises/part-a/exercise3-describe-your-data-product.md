# Exercise 3: Describe Your Data Product

The data contracts from [Exercise 1](exercise1-put-your-data-under-contract.md) and [Exercise 2](exercise2-data-contract-evolution.md) describe the *interface* of your data. But consumers also want to know about the **data product** behind it: who owns it, what it is for, and which contracts it offers. That is what the [Open Data Product Standard (ODPS)](https://bitol-io.github.io/open-data-product-standard/latest/) is for.

Note that there is *one* data product — even though it currently offers *two* contract versions. The product is the stable unit of ownership; its ports evolve.

## Create the Data Product

1. Create a new file `orders.odps.yaml` with this skeleton:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1.0.0
   kind: DataProduct
   id: orders # snake_case of the name
   name: Orders
   version: 2.0.0
   status: active
   domain: ecommerce
   description:
     purpose: # what is this data product for?
     limitations: # what should consumers know before using it?
   ```

2. Add an **output port** per data contract. The `contractId` must match the `id` of the respective data contract:

   ```yaml
   outputPorts:
     - name: orders_v1
       description: Orders and line items tables in PostgreSQL (v1, superseded by v2)
       type: tables
       version: 1.0.0
       contractId: orders_v1
     - name: orders_v2
       description: # ...
       type: tables
       version: 2.0.0
       contractId: orders_v2
   ```

3. Add `team` and `support` — you can reuse what you defined in the contracts:

   ```yaml
   team:
     name: order_data_team
     members:
       - username: owner@example.com
         role: Owner

   support:
     - channel: "#order-data-help"
       url: https://example.slack.com/archives/order-data-help
       tool: slack
   ```

## Validate

4. Validate your data product description against the official JSON schema:

   ```
   uvx check-jsonschema --schemafile https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitol-io/open-data-product-standard/main/schema/odps-json-schema-latest.json orders.odps.yaml
   ```
